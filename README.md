### By James Leute

A WIP website where I showcase my web development capabilities. This website has full sign-up, logon, checkout and administrative functionalities. 

This project features:
- MySQL integration for adding new plants, managing stock, and deleting. Users can also save their carts content. No duplicate user signup. 
- New sign-up for new users. Complete checkout with stock management. (plants will go out of stock)
- Login/logoff complete with password hash protection.
- Links protected from tabnabbing. 
- Complete french/english translation (without a translator)
- Dynamic array for plant listings with page concept. 
Project coded using MySQL, PHP and Bootstrap

Please contact me if you wish to access the website yourself.
